# Quality Assurance Test Matrices Dashboard

## Overview

This directory serves as the modular repository for all CertifyHub test matrices. The test suite has been intentionally decoupled into specialized functional modules to improve maintainability, reduce merge conflicts within the repository, and allow for targeted regression testing.

By slicing the test cases into functional domains, the QA process can focus on specific risk areas without navigating through a monolithic document. Each module is maintained as an **.xlsx** file to preserve complex formatting, enable data filtering, and ensure accessibility for all project stakeholders.

## Technical Rationale

### Why the Matrices are Sliced in Bits

Slicing the test cases into smaller, domain-specific files is a practice for scalable software projects.

* **Granular Regression:** If a developer updates only the email notification logic, the tester can run only the `communication-email.xlsx` suite instead of a 500-row document, saving significant time.
* **Parallel Execution:** Different testers can work on different modules simultaneously (e.g., one focusing on Security and another on UX) without causing file locks or Git merge conflicts.
* **Faster Debugging:** When a test fails in a small module, the root cause is easier to isolate because the scope of functionality is limited to that specific domain.

### Why a Centralized Matrix Exists

While the sliced files are for daily technical work and incremental Git pushes, the **CertifyHub_Master_Matrix.xlsx** provides the necessary "Single Source of Truth."

* **Stakeholder Visibility:** Project managers and clients require a high-level overview of project health. A central matrix allows for the generation of pivot tables and progress charts.
* **End-to-End Traceability:** A centralized file ensures that cross-module dependencies (e.g., an Admin issuing a certificate that must then be verified in the Portal) are tracked in one place to ensure the entire system flow works.

## Detailed Module Explanations

### admin-module.xlsx

This module serves as the core of the application’s business logic. It validates the administrative workflow, specifically the transition from template selection to certificate issuance. Tests here ensure that the system handles data ingestion from Excel files correctly, validates mandatory fields like recipient names and emails, and maintains session integrity during the generation process.

### verification-portal.xlsx

This module is dedicated to the public-facing side of the application. It tests the search engine logic that allows external users to validate certificates via ID. Key scenarios include verifying the accuracy of the status returned (valid vs. invalid) and ensuring that the portal remains accessible and functional for non-authenticated users.

### security-hardening.xlsx

This is the most technically rigorous module, designed to test the system's resilience against malicious intent. It moves beyond functional testing to validate:

* **Session and Token Security:** Ensuring that expired or tampered JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are strictly rejected by the backend.
* **Injection Vulnerabilities:** Confirming that all input fields are sanitized against SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
* **Payload Validation:** Testing if the system can detect malicious scripts disguised as legitimate Excel file extensions.

### communication-email.xlsx

Since certificate delivery is a critical success factor for CertifyHub, this module validates the integration with Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It tests delivery reliability across multiple providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) and ensures that PDF attachments are delivered without corruption or loss of data.

### asset-validation.xlsx

This module focuses on the technical assets generated by the system, specifically the QR codes. Testing here involves verifying that the generated QR codes are unique to each certificate, scannable by various devices, and correctly redirected to the specific verification URL without latency.

### ux-performance.xlsx

This module monitors the system’s behavior under various conditions. It tests UI responsiveness across mobile and desktop breakpoints to ensure a seamless experience. Additionally, it includes performance-based tests, such as bulk-processing 30+ certificates, to ensure the system handles concurrent requests without timing out or crashing.

## Usage Standards

1. **Format:** All files must remain in **.xlsx** to support advanced filtering and conditional formatting.
2. **Incremental Commit:** When working on unfinished tests, update the modular file only. Do not update the Master Matrix until the module reaches a "Ready" status.
3. **Environment:** Local testing (e.g., LocalStack) should be prioritized for high-volume execution in these modules to avoid unnecessary cloud costs.
